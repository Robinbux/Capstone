# Quantum Safe Communication

Modern encryption algorithms are often based on methods like prime factorization and 
will therefore become obsolete in the post quantum era, where algorithms like Shorâ€™s 
algorithm are able to do these tasks in a reasonable amount of time. 
For that time, people are working on quantum safe encryption, 
which is set to be secure for quantum computers as well. 
In this Capstone Project, I have written a quantum-safe chat application, 
using said algorithms for a quantum- safe TLS communication between client and server and 
lastly a quantum-safe KEM(Key encapsulation mechanism) algorithm between client and client.

## Setup
For a manual reproduction, please install [liboqs-python](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python) and the forked [openssl](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl). 

Install a custom Python version (Needed for the openssl verification)
```shell
export PYTHON_VERSION=3.9.5
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/${PYTHON_VERSION}/Python-${PYTHON_VERSION}.tar.xz
tar -xvf Python-${PYTHON_VERSION}.tar.xz
rm Python-${PYTHON_VERSION}.tar.xz
```

Build liboqs
```shell
# Replace OPENSSL_PATH and LIBOQS_PATH with your installation path
cd ${LIBOQS_PATH}
mkdir build && cd build && cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${OPENSSL_PATH}/oqs .. \
    && ninja && ninja install
```

Build liboqs-openssl
```shell
cd ${OPENSSL_PATH}
./Configure no-shared linux-x86_64 -lm
./Configure --prefix=/Users/robinbux/quantum-new/openssl --openssldir=/Users/robinbux/quantum-new/openssl/ssl
make -j -l
```

Build Python
```shell
./configure --with-openssl=${OPENSSL_PATH} --with-http_ssl_module
```

### Create Certificates
Create private and public CA certs
```shell
export SIG_ALG="dilithium5"
mkdir ca && cd ca && ${OPENSSL_PATH}/apps/openssl req -x509 -new -newkey ${SIG_ALG} -keyout ${SIG_ALG}_CA.key \
    -out ${SIG_ALG}_CA.crt -nodes -subj "/CN=pq-cert CA" -days 365 \
    -config opt/openssl/apps/openssl.cnf
```
Create server private key
```shell
mkdir server && cd server && ${OPENSSL_PATH}/apps/openssl genpkey -algorithm ${SIG_ALG} -out ${SIG_ALG}_srv.key
```
Create certificate signing request
```shell
cd server && ${OPENSSL_PATH}/apps/openssl req -new -newkey ${SIG_ALG} -keyout ${SIG_ALG}_srv.key \
    -out ${SIG_ALG}_srv.csr -nodes -subj "/CN=pq-cert" \
    -config ${OPENSSL_PATH}/apps/openssl.cnf
```
Create ext file
```shell
echo $'authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer \n\
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE \n\
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment \n\
subjectAltName = @alt_names \n\
[alt_names] \n\
DNS.1 = localhost \n\
IP.1 = 127.0.0.1 ' > server/v3.ext
```
Let the CA sign the request
```shell
${OPENSSL_PATH}/apps/openssl x509 -req -in server/${SIG_ALG}_srv.csr -out server/${SIG_ALG}_srv.crt \
    -CA ca/${SIG_ALG}_CA.crt -CAkey ca/${SIG_ALG}_CA.key -CAcreateserial -days 365 -extfile v3.ext
```

## RUN
To run the application, you need to use the custom Python installation. Having that aliased as `pq-python`, you can start the server with
```shell
pq-python start_server.py
```
and the client with 
```shell
pq-python start_client.py ${NAME}
```
